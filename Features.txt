- Asset Manager
	- Asset Types
		- Models via Assimp.NET
		- Textures via System.Drawing (support for many files, but no TGA) or DDS
			- Support for sRGB loading to get linear textures
		- ObjectShaders via XML
		- Localized dictionaries via XML
		- AudioBuffers (Sounds), only PCM WAV
		- BLOBs (custom binary storage) via .dat
	- Supports different asset sources
		- File system
		- Zip file
		- Web (load assets directly from your server)
- Flexible log system
	- Can write to custom streams or just the console
- Wrapping of OpenGL objects
	- FrameBuffer
	- Buffer
	- Textures
	- VertexArray
	- Shaders
		- Object Shaders (with world matrices)
		- Post Processing Shaders (fixed VertexShader, custom FragmentShader)
		- Automatic shader uniforms via Properties + Attributes
- Multithreaded architecture
	- Co-Routines
	- Deferred asset loading
- Input Manager
	- Keyboard
	- Mouse
	- Joysticks
- Node-based scene management
	- Rendering
		- Simple (plain texture, no shading)
		- Deferred (Rendering with support for lots of lights)
			- Point Lights
			- Normal Mapping
	- Cameras
		- Scene, Camera and Renderer are separated so they can be combined in various ways
- Component-based scene nodes
	- Renderer (Draws a model)
	- RigidBody (Bullet physics rigid body)
	- BoxShape (Physics collider)
	- SphereShape (Physics collider)
	- PolygonShape (Physics collider)
	- PointLight (Represents a point light)
	- Scriptable (Lua scripting for nodes)
- Simple Materials
	- Physical properties
		- Kinetic friction
		- Static friction
		- Restitution
	- Visual properties
		- Shaders
		- Transparency
- Post Processing Pipeline
	- Flexible and dynamic stages
	- Stages can be turned on or off or added/removed in realtime without any efforts
- Post Processing Shaders
	- Dithering
		Allows to create a low noise function on your screen that will hide some artifacts
	- Gamma Correction
		Allows custom gamma correction
	- Light Scattering
		Godray effect
	- Tonemapping
		Simple tonemapping to adjust HDR rendering
- Extended Library
	- Floating Point Colors with predefined named colors (X11-WebColors)
	- GameMath with methods that use floats and degrees instead of double and radian
	- Resource for loading embedded resources easier
	- Singleton for creating singleton classes
- Sound
	- Audio Source
	- Audio Listener
	- WAVE PCM Loading
