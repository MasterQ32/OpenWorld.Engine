o Scene Management
	o Improve Scene Tree
		o Components don't need to use the Draw event
		o New methods:
			o PreRender  [Gets called before any child is rendered]
			o Render [Gets called if the component has to be rendered]
			o PostRender [Gets called after all childs have been rendered]
		o Only render component if Component.Enabled
		o Update modification of Transform only in update step, not in draw step.
