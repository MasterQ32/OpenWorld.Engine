OpenWorld.Engine
================

A C# game engine based on OpenGL and OpenTK.

The engine is based on an XNA-like design but has some improvements done.
There is no sound or physics engine supported yet but it is planned to change
this later.

To compile this, you'll need Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or newer and following libraries:
o OpenTK (www.opentk.com)
o Assimp.Net (https://code.google.com/p/assimp-net/)
o SharpFont (included, get it with nuget or at https://github.com/Robmaister/SharpFont)

If you use it and encounter a bug, please report it to felix@masterq32.de
