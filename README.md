OpenWorld.Engine
================

A C# game engine based on OpenGL and OpenTK.

The engine design is a mixture of the XNA Framework and Unity. You have low level
functionality similar to XNA with shaders, textures, direct draw calls, ... but also
high level functionality similar to Unity with component based scene management,
materials and a deferred renderer.
